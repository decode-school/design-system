# Library
We use shadcn as component library. shadcn is a design system that provides a set of reusable components and guidelines for building consistent and accessible user interfaces.   
The main advantage is that we are the owners of our UI components, so we can customize them as we need to fit our design system.  

## Documention
shadcn is mainly based on headless RadixUI and Tailwind. If you need more documention about the components, you can check the following links:
- [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs)
- [RadixUI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)

Some other library are used for special needs, sucha as Tanstack table for data tables and such. Consider checking each library documentation for more information.

## Not implemented components
While most of the components from shadcn are implemented, there are some that are not. The reason is that they might not be needed yet or doesn't fit the actual feature set.  
If you need a component that is not implemented, please create a new issue in the design system repository. ([Github repository](https://github.com/decode-school/design-system/issues))
